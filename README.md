# big-12-2010s-offenses
Project to perform descriptive analytics on Big 12 CFB offenses of the 2010s for the purpose of improving play calling
tendencies for the University of Texas Longhorns college football team.

# Purpose of the project
This project was constructed to satisfy the requirements of Colorado State University - Global Campus's capstone course
for the Masters degree program in Data Analytics. This included demonstration of proficiency in a number of potential tools.
Python, SQL, and Tableau were used to manage the selected dataset, perform descriptive analytics testing, and generate
useful visualizations for both the paper as well as the presentation given regarding the findings.

# Future of the project
While the requirements of the capstone course are satisfied by the initial conditions of the repository, this project may
ultimately serve as a base upon which further analysis can be constructed. The project demonstrates many useful techniques
which may prove to be handy in further analysis on a wider scale. Expansion of the dataset, for example, can offer many options
to improve the usefulness of the findings, extending from offensive play calling to further scheme, personnel package, and
recruiting decisions made by different college football teams, especially those within the Big 12.
